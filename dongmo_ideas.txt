When you're talking marriage you want your proposal to be exciting and fun. Personalize it as much as possible and 
tailor it to what your bride-to-be loves to do. If she enjoys the outdoors you could go on an all-day hiking excursion and 
then propose at the top of the mountain. A boat ride is another option. You could work with the score board operators and 
propose at a baseball or basketball game but make sure you'll get a positive response or you could have some serious egg on 
your face! Yes, it has been known to happen.

Have you ever tried to record a video with a laptop or a front facing camera (all in one desktop) of a subject other than yourself. It is not easy, so it would be very productive to have a rear built in camera so that the user could just sit at the desktop monitor as normal and record the subject that is in front. It would be nice if the camera could change directions as well.

Universities and colleges should make students who apply to the school submit a business plan for their chosen career. 
Have them research job prospects for that field and include that as part of the report. This could steer students to better 
paths before it's too late and avoid painful surprises after they graduate.

but who still seem to know you. It would let you record a snippet of conversation and then attach a name to that snippet 
after the conversation is over. That way the next time they call you could hit an ID key so your phone could match the voice 
with the recordings and display the caller's name (or whisper it into your ear through the earpiece if you went for the more 
hi-tech version).
